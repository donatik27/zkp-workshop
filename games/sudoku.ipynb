    "In Sudoku, there is a $9 \\times 9$ board of cells. Cells contain numbers from 1 to 9. At the start, most cells are empty. The goal is to fill in the empty cells, according to the rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules are that every number must occur exactly once in every row, in every column and in every 3x3 sub-square (box).\n",
