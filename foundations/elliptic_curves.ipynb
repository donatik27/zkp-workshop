    "I just want to use elliptic curves. I want to understand **what** they do, not **how**. Great, you are in good company. Even experts treat curves as a black box that does what you expect. Have you ever driven a car? It's a thing that moves you around. You don't need to hold an engineering degree to understand that. That is the **what**. Could you ever build a car? No! That is the **how**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elliptic curves are a set of 2D points. Each point has a number attached to it: There is a zeroth point, a first point, a second point, and so on. You can add these points like integers: The first point plus the second point equals the third point: 1 + 2 = 3; and so on. So the curve points behave like integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one important difference from integers: If you see a point (its x and y coordinates), then it is difficult to know the number of this point. Is it the first point, the tenth, the thousandth? We cannot do division like for integers. We have to add the first point onto itself 1 + 1 + ... until we reach the point that we saw. This is fast for a few million iterations, but what if we have 2^256 many points? Oops, this takes longer than the universe will last!\n",
    "\n",
