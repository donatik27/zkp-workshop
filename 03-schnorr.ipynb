    "This commitment is also called the public **nonce**, and it includes the secret nonce. The nonce hides the secret key in the Prover's response. Without hiding, the Verifier could easily extract the secret key. This process is similar to the random color mappings from before, but we didn't need a commitment for that.\n",
